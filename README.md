# Universalia
Official language for 7 billion people


I think that Russia, the US, China, Brazil, Germany, Japan, and France should work together to build a universal (common) language. Groups of linguists and people who speak multiple languages could contribute to building this new language.

Everything could be done on a website where everyone adds words and ideas for grammar. For the words chosen in the vocabulary people from all around the world will have to vote online.

Thousands of people will contribute to creating the language using the website. Linguists, philosophers and other people will be able to share their ideas.

This will be the easiest language to learn for all 7 billion people.
People should be able to be fluent in this language in a week.

We will have to build it from scratch. It can be based on existing words from other languages and some created ones that people think are easy to learn.

This language will be created to be easy to learn and use by 7 billion people.

To make people want to learn it, we should create a language with a minimum number of words (500 words).

There are already words common to languages. They are usually about computers and some fields of science.

The criteria by which we chose the number of words in the language: easy to learn, useful, billions of people want to adopt it just to have a common language on the entire planet (even if it has 500 words)

If the word "heavenly" sounds great, nice, good or powerful in every language I'm sure the new word we use or create will sound as great after using it for a while.

The words we chose should be easy to pronounce for everyone. There must be words that are easy to pronounce by people who natively speak different languages. There must be something in all of us that lets us speak certain words the same way. Let's find what is common and use it to create a language that is easy to learn by everyone.

At first we should add to the language 500 words (the most useful possible). If the language is useful and people adopt it, we can keep it at 500 words for many years if we want.
We should include words useful for people who have to live 1 month in a foreign country. (eat, got, bathroom, etc.)
If 500 words are too few or if many people adopt the language then we should extend it to have at most 1000 words.

This language should have its own public website. If new words are added, everyone in the world should know about them. For a few years the vocabulary should not get larger than 1500 words.
New words should be added to the vocabulary in a standard way so that everyone is up to date.
There should be exactly one word for every object or abstract thing. This will keep the number of words low.

I'm not sure but we may find it useful for the language to contain special gestures for words like "we", "others" so we don't have to use new words for "I" and "You".

The language should have simple grammar (verbs: past, present, future). It should also be extendable (grammar, vocabulary).

New words could be created based on existing words. We could create 1 word from 2-3 other words. We could add a simple termination to all substantives and make them all that are suitable verbs and adjectives.

After many years in case we decide to extend the language, I think we should we should stop at 2000 words.
If the language is adopted by at least 2 billion people, we can try to convince another 1 billion to learn it and then extend it to 3000 words.

All the verbs in the present tense have the same termination. Similar terminations are used for verbs in the past and future tenses (all the verbs are regular).

Make the language easily used by text reading and voice recognition software.

Imagine being in China or Europe or Brazil as a tourist and being able to talk with people in a language that contains 1000 words and that has a very simple grammar.

Advantages to having one common language on the entire planet

1. People unite because they speak the same language and start wars because they speak different languages. It is less probable to start wars between countries. Difference in language can separate us the same way religions do.
2. When someone wants to write a book or a song, they will spend 3x the time to make it the best, just because they have an audience of 7 billion people.
3. Some languages have only 1 million speakers. If they have access to a language spoken by billions they also have access to their science.
4. People from different countries would collaborate more easily on scientific projects like the ISS
5. When traveling abroad you have a common language with the people who live there
4. New generations will be able to learn such a language natively. If many people speak the language

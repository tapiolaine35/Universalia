Make a language that is easy to learn and speak by 7 billion people

Idea 1
We could simplify English (grammer, vocabulary) or another language.
Right now 365 million people speak English natively and 942 million people speak it in total. Let's make it so that 7 billion people speak English. It could be another language.

Idea 2
Create the language from scratch. I should be very easy to learn and to speak for everyone. It is very important to make it easy to learn and use for people who already speak Eglish, Chinese, Arabic, Spanish, Hindi, Russian, Bengali, Portughese, Malay, French, German, and Japanese.


There are other created languages, but in their creation only 1-2 people got involved. Universalia will be created by thousands of people.
